# Approaches for instance segmentation 
In this we will be discussing various approaches in which we can implement instance segmentation using various pretrained models such as mask-RCNN etc trained on coco dataset or Custom dataset.

First lets discuss what is instance segmentation and how it is different from semantic segmentation:
* Instance segmentation refers to method of identifying object outlines at the pixel level. **Instance segmentation** includes identification of boundaries of the objects at the detailed pixel level. For example, in the image below, there are 7 balloons at certain locations, and these are the pixels that belong to each one of the balloons
